                "When to use ‘a’, ‘an’ and ‘the’ before a noun in a proper english sentence. We use these  when we speak, when we write  and they is very important in grammar.",
                "The first one is ‘an’ . ‘An’ is used in the singular noun. We use it before a vowel or vowel sound. In English we have five vowels. These are: ‘a’, ‘i’, ‘e’, ‘o’, ‘u’.  So if you have a vowel that begins the noun, you have to use ‘an’.",
                "Example:",
                "We have to say ‘An eye’ because the word ‘eye’ begins with a vowel.",
                "Or if the word begins with the vowel sound. A vowel sound is useally always the latter ‘H’. For example the word ‘hour’ [ˈaʊə].  we do not even say the ‘H’ word. It sounds like we’re saying ‘our’. So because this word ‘hour’ sounds like a vowel because the ‘H’ is silent we have to say ‘an hour’.",
                "The naxt one is ‘a’. The very first letter of alphabet.  ‘a’ is a vowel. Don’t let that confuse you.  ‘a’ we use for again the singular noun. If whe noun is plural, if the noun has an ‘s’  do not use an ‘article’. So ‘a’ we use for a singular noun in a general form. You can think of this  easier as replacing it with the word ‘any’. So if you go to a coffee shop and they have five muffins and they’re all the same muffin.  you’re going to say the person that works at the coffee shop.",
                "‘Hello. I’d like a muffin ‘  you do not get to choose or pick what muffin you get. You can choose the flavor, but you can’t specifically choose  which muffin you would like.  It’s the same as saying ‘any’. It's like saying ‘i’d like any muffin’, ‘i’d like anything. Just give me something ‘. It's use when you don’t care which one it is. You just want one of something."
